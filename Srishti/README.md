After comparing the stemming and lemmatization techniques:

- **Stemmed Vocabulary Size:** 176002
- **Lemmatized Vocabulary Size:** 204420

**Observations**:
- Stemming reduces vocabulary more aggressively, but sometimes at the cost of word clarity (e.g., "running" â†’ "run" vs "runn").
- Lemmatization retains more original words, offering richer vocabulary with better semantic meaning.
- The word cloud and bar plots also reflect clearer terms with lemmatization.
